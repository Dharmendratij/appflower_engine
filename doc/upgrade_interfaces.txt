I have recently (between ~1040 and ~1070 revisions) made some changes in AppFlowerPlugin and sfGuardPlugin.
I introduced few interfaces so from now on an application that is using
AppFlowerPlugin must implement those interfaces for AppFlowerPlugin to work correctly.

Steps that needs to be taken when moving from "old" AF version to current
 - alter your app.yml to contain correct values for:
   parser_skip_toolbar, parser_skip_west and cdn_active options
   defaults for those options has changed
 - change your application configuration class to implement AppFlowerApplicationInterface
 - change your app lib/myUser class to implement AppFlowerSecurityUser interface

Additionally for "security" related things you may need to go through following tasks.
afGuardPlugin (you should get rid of sfGuardPlugin and start to use afGuardPlugin instead - look into README file in afGuardPlugin for more informations):
 - make sure it is enabled and that sfGuardPlugin is gone and disabled
 - replace all calls to sfGuardUser and make them calls to afGuardUser
 - change sfGuardBasicSecurityFilter to afGuardBasicSecurityFilter in filters.yml
 - change login_module in settings.yml to afGuardAuth and change enabled_modules accordingly
 - change your app lib/myUser class to extend afGuardSecurityUser
