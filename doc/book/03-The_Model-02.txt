## So what makes Database and Models so special?

In the pervious section we saw that your application will need some kind of storage mechanism to store information, and to 
obtain that information later, when needed. 

And why to use a database for this purpose?

Because experience shows it's the *best* way to do it.

A *Database or Model*:

* Stores your information in a *simple* way. It's easy to understand not only for computers, but also
  for humans!

* Stores your information in the *good* way. This means it **works with any kind of information**, no matter if it's your
  home CD collection or the complete list of products of all WalMart stores in the US. It will just handle it.
  
* Is *fast and smart*. Your application can to store info faster than you blink, and can obtain it in many different ways.:
  
  Got all products of your business stored? Well, let's list them. Order them by price, list only those electronics whoes price is more 
  than USD 200, or find a certain product, the one with those characteristics the customer wants. 
  This is all possible with Models, and much more! 
  
  And you know what? With AppFlower, you won't even need to know how to do all this. Just tell AppFlower what you want using simple tools. 
  It will take care about rest automatically.

So basically that's why a Model is usually a good choice. It will fit your application's needs, no matter what. *Models* are fast, 
can store anything, can handle huge amount of info, and they allow you to obtain the stored information in the way you wanna see it.

Believe me, it's proven. They have been around in last 30 years, and that's no coincidence.

OK so now you know why are Models good for you, and why to use them.

But how to picture all this? How does a Model look like?

We'll figure this out in the next section.

<div class="note">
It should be noted that Models and Databases are not the same. They are related, but not equal. A database is a storage mechanism, a Model
is a way to work with it. However, using AppFlower it is not really important to see this difference. Let's just say AppFlower uses 
Models to hanlde storage needs. For this reason, we we'll use the term Model from now on to refer to storage in general.
