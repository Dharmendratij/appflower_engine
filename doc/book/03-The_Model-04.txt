## Models in Action

So let's start up Studio. For now, you don't have to load the project you created earlier, the default project (playground) will do.

Maybe you already noticed the *Model pane* on the left. This is where all Models are listed.

In this chapter we will actually create our music list using AppFlower Studio. Don't worry, it won't be hard. Just follow
the easy steps below:

## Creating new Model

* Let's create our *Song* model to get started. Click on the **"Add Model"** button located at the bottom of the Model list.
 
* A new entry appears in the list. Its name is not right, change it to **Song** then *press enter*.  

That's it. Our model called *Song* is just being created. Remember? At this point, it is just an empty shell, we need
to add its characteristics to make it useful. 

## Editing Models - adding or modifying characteristics

* Doubleclick on Song in Model list, this opens the Model editor.

This editor has two tabs *Song* and *Model Config*. 

The first one shows *stored information*, obviously, it is empty at the moment.

The second one is where you *add, remove or modify characteristics*, let's click on that.

Now you see a table structrure with several columns. It looks like this because AppFlower system sees the characteristics of a Model in a bit
different way than you do. For you, these are just names. The system, however needs to know some details about them in order to handle
them properly.

Most of those columns may seem to be a bit mysterious to you, but don't worry about them, since we need only two of them for now. These are
enough to create simple applications, like our music catalogue, a phonebook and more.
The rest are used by advanced applications only, and I'll explain each of them later, in the next chapter.

So for now, let us concentrate on the two columns we really need:

* The first column is **Name**. This is the name of the characteristic you are about to create. It's just a word. Remember? We defined 
the following characteristics for our Song model:

	title
	author
	genre
	location
	

So let's add the first one! Click to the first row in the **Name** column and type "title".

* The scond column is called **Type**. This determines *what kind of information* a "title" is. 

It is necessary to define this, because "information" is just an umbrella term: a word, a sentence, a full paragraph, a number, a date or 
the current time all represent information, but they have different purposes, so to say, they are different **types**. 
The Model is well aware of this, thus it treats each of these in a slightly different way, that is best for that kind of information. 
It does this to provide the *best results* for you and to make its storage work *fast and smooth*.

However, the Model cannot find out what sort information a "title" should be on its own, you have to help by selecting the proper type.

So let's click on the first row of **Type** column. A list of choices opens. But what the heck is this? Those "types" listed are either
chinese or they were invented by crazy people. They look weird, don't they?

No worries. The following simple guide will help you choose in 10 seconds. This guide is not only for our exmple model, you can use
this with any future Model you create as well.

Is the information you wanna to store:

***a name of a person or a product, a word, a sentence or a pharse no longer than 255 letters?***
If so, choose *varchar*.

***an address, email, phone, fax or cell number?***
If so, choose *varchar*.

***a longer piece of text, like a paragraph?****
If so, choose *longvarchar*

***an answer to a yes or no kind of question?****
If so, choose *booelan*

***a number without fractional part?***
If so, choose *integer*

***a number with fractional part?***
If so, choose *float*

***anything related to money or an other numeric value that has to be very precise?***
If so, choose *decimal*

***a date or time?***
If so, choose *timestamp*


Which one to choose? Well, we can assume that the title of a song will always consist of a few words, so *varchar* is right choice. 

Simple, isn't? Of course there are many other types, but for most appliactions the above will be sufficient. If you wanna learn more
about the rest, check out the next section, "Models in Action Continued - Advanced features".


* Click to anywhere in the first row, a selection appears. Now click to ***Insert -> Insert after***. This creates a new row,
room for the next characteristic.

* It's time to add the rest of the characteristics to our model. To do that, simply repeat the last three steps for each of the remaining 
characteristics. Just like "title", the "author", "genre" and "location" can be also described by a few words, so the *varchar* type will
work for those as well.

* You are almost done! There is only one more thing to do.: you have to add a new characteristic called "id" to your Model. 
Please, click to the the first row, then click ***Insert -> Insert before***. This inserts a new row before "title". 
Name this new entry "id" and *make all the other settings blank*.

This is a special characteristic which you will use not only with this, but with each and every Model you create. The id is like an 
*automatic counter*. Whenever you store a new piece of information (a song in this case), the counter will be increased by one, thus 
the new entry *gets numbered*. For now, you don't have to dive into the details of this, just keep in mind that this is an important, 
unique identifier used by the system, and it will be useful to you as well later.

<div class="important">
For the sake of this tutorial, we created "id" as the last characteristic, but normally this should be the first one you add.
No matter what information you wanna store or how your Model looks like, it should have "id" as its first characteristic.
</div>

Congratulations! You've just created your first Model. Now it is ready to store your data, just click to the other tab in the Model 
editor and you can start adding your songs right away.

## Some title here..

You should take a break now, you deserve it! Have a coffee and some snacks, check your favourite blog. 

Back already? Eager to learn? How about a little practice first?

<div class="exercise">
What you know so far is enough to create simple Models. Why don't you try to build a Model for something else? For instance, 
a list of your contacts, all the people you know. This will be a new Model called "People". Try to think about what characteristics it 
should have, what information you want to store about your contacts? You can always check your smartphone for hints, it surely has a 
similar application.
</div>

The People Model is a good exercise. It's somewhat similar to the music catalogue, yet it's different. Try to create it, and add some
entries to it.

Like I said before, there is more about Models. They have some pretty useful advanced features as well. When you completed this little
exercise, and feel ready to move on, check out the next section to learn more about these.
