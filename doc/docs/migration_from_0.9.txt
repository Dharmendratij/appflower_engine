== New Features ==

=== No layoutExt() ===
It is not needed to call XmlParser::layoutExt() at the end of your action.
It will be called automatically.

=== No json_encode() for response ===
It is possible to return an array from your action.
It will be automatically encoded as JSON.

=== No <i:proxy url="parser/listjson"/> ===
It is not needed to specify the URL to the listjson proxy.
Its default value is OK.

=== No type="static" on a method ===
It is not needed to specify type="static" on an i:method element.
It is the default value.

=== No <i:display> ===
The <i:display> element should not be used. It is ignored now.
Use the column attribute hidden="true" instead.

=== Action name is the default tooltip ===
A row action name is the default tooltip for the action.

=== Action conditions use PHP syntax ===
New action conditions should use PHP syntax:
condition="MyPeer::isEditable($id)"

=== No edit[0] ===
Use edit[name] instead of edit[0][name] in new actions.
The values from the edit[0][] array are provided also in the edit[] array.


== Changed Features ==

Ivo will do the migration for LogInspect.
The changes are mentioned here to keep you informed.

=== Passing of remoteLoad anode ===
A grid tree with remoteLoad=true should pass {anode}
as an additional parameter to its datasource method.
It is OK to pass also any other parameters.

=== All datasource methods are "realtime" ===
It is not needed to set $action->realtime=true.
A new datasource method call is done for each listjson request.
A file datasource should pass the {datafile} parameter explicitly
its datasource method.

It also not needed to set static_real_pagination=true.
An action with a static datasource should pass the filters
to the datasource method explicity.

=== ImmExtJsLayoutFilter is removed ===
Don't use ImmExtJsLayoutFilter in your filters.yml.
It is useless in tag 0.9. It is removed in trunk.
