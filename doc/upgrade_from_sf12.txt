If you trying to move on to newest version of symfony with appFlower based application this readme is for you.

I was updating everything in seedControl project context so needed changes can be different in other projects.

Generally the most important step is to follow this article:
http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_4/en/upgrade

You should probably look for symfony plugins you are using in your project.
This can be the most difficult part unless you have luck and all plugins have newer version perpared for sf1.3/1.4

After you'll make sure about plugins it should be correct to switch to current
AF trunk version before next steps.

Below is description of steps that I made when upgrading.
1. Switch you ProjectConfiguration to sf 1.3
   It is correct to have AF updated to trunk and use 1.3 version. This will probably
   allow you to run your app event that it has deprecated methods used.
2. Run "./symfony project:upgrade1.3

There is a chance that right now everything will work.
If no - resolve any errors you'll get.

3. Run "./symfony project:validate" - this will give you some places you need to change.
I got mainly to do following changes:
- replace sfLoader::loadHelpers() calls to sfProjectConfiguration::getActive()->loadHelpers()
- change $this->getRequest()->hasParameter('edit[0][id]') calls to
"
$formData = $this->getRequest()->hasParameter('edit');
$formData = $formData[0];
$form['id']
"
-

After that you should switch your ProjectConfiguration to use sf1.4
And that's all :)
