AppFlower Application running in secured environment guide

The goal is to have symfony + AF application + studio plugin running correctly in secured environment.
Correctly means here that we want all files created through lifecycle of a project with minimum permissions.
That minimum permissions is 700 in most cases.

This is not so straightforward becasue symfony itself has few places where hihger than 700 permissions
are set on some files.

You need to have project properly configured so here are all steps needed to be taken.
1. Create config/permissions.yml file with following content:
folders:
  root:
    path: '/'
    mode: 'u+rwx,go-rwx'
    recursive: true


2. Change your application configuration file (apps/frontend/config/frontendConfiguration.class.php):

2.1 Add require statement at the beginning of the file:
require_once dirname(dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__)))).'/plugins/appFlowerPlugin/lib/afConfigCache.class.php';

2.2 Add getConfigCache() method
    public function getConfigCache()
    {
        if (null === $this->configCache) {
            $this->configCache = new afConfigCache($this);
        }

        return $this->configCache;
    }

3. Configure AF engine and studio plugins by adding following to app.yml
all:
  afs:
    chmod_enabled: false
  appFlower:
    chmod_enabled: false






Important note for sysadmins!
If you are clearing the cache of given project and you are working as other system
user than Apache server will be using - DO NOT RUN 'symfony cc' task!
That task creates one file inside cache folder and it will have wrong permissions.
Instead you can just clear cache/ directory and then on first request mentioned file will be created.
